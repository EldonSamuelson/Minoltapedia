**This is the Reddit Markdown Repo which *should* sync from local files, whereas the Gitbook Repo should only be updated occasionally from the Gitbook-authored [MinoltaWiki Repo](https://github.com/EldonSamuelson/Minolta-Wiki) and not edited locally or directly through github**. God, this was a PITA to create, so don't delete this even if it's old. The gitbook stuff is already quite dated as it is.
