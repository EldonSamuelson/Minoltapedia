#### **Mirror Baffle Loose Flap**

*What:* 

[Your photos come out 'cropped'](https://preview.redd.it/why-is-the-bottom-half-of-the-images-black-v0-0qxf0kcvlrce1.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=ef022e8081625206aec019fdd5f6b6ba14e73960) or ['warped'](https://preview.redd.it/shutter-curtain-loose-v0-w6mvgkqzn49c1.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=4ce243c297245b686be8588d8ca3a85e5d9ce028), and [it can be seen in the negatives](https://preview.redd.it/issue-with-minolta-srt-101-v0-0vrq3wkk5ice1.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=b7bb6f9900f00bc57434bfdfc615291780dc2043). This can affect ALL SRT Models.

*Why:* 

There's a small fabric 'mirror baffle' between the Mirror and the Film Gate that can get loose and obstruct the film Frame. [Example 1](https://preview.redd.it/why-is-the-bottom-half-of-the-images-black-v0-q92z1xz4prce1.jpeg?width=320&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=13712f179ef4261e8215d747ca249f010d748dc6), [Example 2](https://preview.redd.it/issue-with-minolta-srt-101-v0-v805pxmk5ice1.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=46c02b4228361422f8c0127d944a6dfa0b7f2f16). It's not your shutter curtain because the problem is vertical, whereas your shutter is horizontally travelling.

*Remedy:* 

Carefully re-insert the fabric back into place, [under a bar that is behind the mirror](https://i.imgur.com/vQyhQUR.jpeg). There are several ways to do this; 

For all of the methods, you have to be extremely careful not to touch the Shutter Curtain, and only the Mirror Baffle Fabric. You don't want to have leaks through the Shutter Curtain. You should be able to slide it in carefully, by using a tweezers to grab the corners at the loose edges and running them through the tabs/bar. I would try lightly pulling one corner at a time through the middle of the bar before moving them to the edges afterwards, and then [smartening it out](https://i.imgur.com/8QZmXya.jpeg) by pulling the centre after the corners are through.

If you have a 101 like in the following pictures, there's a Mirror Lock Up switch on the front, next to the name engraving and the Timer Switch. That'll flip the Mirror up while the MLU switch is on and give you a free hand to help with the operation. Then when [the Fabric is snuggly back in](https://i.imgur.com/T9N0AV9.jpeg), turn off the MLU switch so the Mirror goes back down.

If you don't, you'll have to get a Shutter Release Cable, attach it to the Shutter Button, set the camera to B and press the Shutter Release Cable, and lock it (most of them have a lock function that acts like holding the shutter down). Then repeat the operation as described before, and then unlock the Shutter Release Cable when you're done to drop the Mirror.

If you don't have either available to you, you have two riskier options. These risk damage to your camera and I don't recommend them, but this is safest way of doing them. I had an SRT without MLU have this problem once and I did it with the first method below.

- Very carefully, lift up the Mirror with another pair of tweezers, hold it, and then do the operation with the other pair of tweezers. You could try using something to prop up the Mirror, but don't use anything thin and sharp like toothpicks, but wide and flat like a flat Lego piece or a cut-to-size piece of cardboard. Don't want something sharp to slip into the Shutter Curtain while it's down and pierce it. 
- Alternatively, but just as carefully, do the operation while you hold down the shutter on B mode. You can't use anything to prop up the Mirror because if you slip off the Shutter, you might damage the Mirror, the Shutter Curtain, or jam up the Curtain entirely with the prop piece.

After fixing it with whatever method you choose, shoot the camera a few times at different shutter speeds to make sure it's solidly in place, and at B so you see if it crumples or folds anywhere. You want the final result to be smooth as possible like in these pictures.

*Where:* 

First experienced by myself (u/Superirish19), but also seen [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/minolta/comments/uf2ezt/is_it_normal_for_my_shutter_curtain_to_not_go_up/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/minolta/comments/18t951c/comment/kfe4fou/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/minolta/comments/1hzg8qv/issue_with_minolta_srt_101/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/minolta/comments/1hzg8qv/comment/m6q1iun) where I fetched these examples from.

#### **Non-Responsive, Loose, or Sluggish Aperture Ring**

*What:*

The Aperture Ring on the SRT on the lens mount is not responding to the movement of the Aperture Ring on the Lens. As in, if you turn the lens to f/16-22, then rotate it back to f/1.7-2, the tab on the camera mount does not spring back and follow it, or it does it very slowly. *If the aperture blades are not responding, or the lens closes down/opens up very slowly, that is a different issue and not what this problem describes (please see the [Lens Troubleshooting Section Below](#minolta-lens-common-problems)).*

*Why:*

There can be a few causes;

1. The Aperture Pulley Cord underneath has either come loose of it's cam piece and jammed...
2. ...come away from the Aperture Ring...
3. ...or it/the ShutterSpeed and/or ISO Pulley Cord(s) have Broken somehow

*Remedy:*

1. The lens mount ring and front plate of the SRT have to be removed and the pulleycord reset into position. This is relatively straightforward, but make sure the pulleycord doesn't get loose and pull back all the way into the camera.
2. The lens mount ring and front plate have to be removed and the pulleycord end (a knot) should be reinserted into the notch of the lens mount ring.This is relatively straightforward, but make sure the pulleycord doesn't get loose and pull back all the way into the camera. If it has gone all the way inside and can't be found from the exterior, seek professional repair help.
3. The SRT needs replacement Aperture/Shutterspeed/ISO pulleycords and needs to be 'restrung'. This is an intensive process and is better done by a professional if you are not experienced in previous mechanical camera repairs.

*Where:*

Personal experience, again from me (u/Superirish19), but independently on several different SRT's. It appears many 'broken' SRT's on EBay also have this issue.

### XK/XM/X1

#### **Mirror Locked Up/'Blackscreen' in Viewfinder**

*What:*

After using your XK on an Auto exposure, on shutter release the Viewfinder goes black, the shutters appear to stay open for a very long time, and the Mirror Lock Up switch located on the Depth of Field Preview Button does not reset the screen.

*What:*

The XK Auto exposure has failed, essentially. This can be due to an ageing drained battery running out of charge mid-shot, or your fingers slipping off the Sense-switch on the front of the camera as you pressed the Shutter. Both essentially make the meter lose power, and so the camera defaults to a 15-second exposure when on Auto mode unpowered.

*Remedy:*

Get a small-ish coin, Cents, Pence, Cent, whatever small denomination. Open and Close the Battery Compartment, *maybe* replace the batteries with some fresh ones if they've been in there a while or you've used the camera a lot lately. The Mirror should drop down as the Battery Compartment also acts as a Mirror-Reset. Replacing the batteries just makes sure it shouldn't happen again. Double check on your next shot that your fingers are firmly pressed on the Sense-switch, or that you have the camera switched ON with the switch next to the Viewfinder.

If in the small likelihood you have done all these steps and the Mirror, or worse, the Shutter is locked open beyond 15 seconds, then you will need to seek professional repair help. You have a bigger problem unfortunately.

### XE

#### Meter Non-Responsive to Aperture Changes

*What:*

Minolta XE-1. Everything working as expected, *EXCEPT* that the meter was a bit jumpy when changing the ISO, and changing the Aperture wouldn't change the meter readout unless you stopped down the meter with the DoF button.

*Why:*

The XE-1 is still partially operated by pulley cords, just like the SRT. However to get the Auto metering function working, it connects a simpler pulley system to an electronic dial, coated with gold. Unfortunately over time that metal oxidises, or simply gets coated in gunk and dust after years of use, with particular hotspots of oxidation occurring between the dial and the contact pins. If you never change the ISO setting very often, it can also occur on the other side of the dial too.

[The Oxidation can get pretty bad as you can see in the 'Before' picture](https://preview.redd.it/before-and-after-xe-contact-oxidation-cleaning-v0-pkcvtnk8mqvd1.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=d9065125ae5154243266c8b52927d5c6e0c58850).

You can *sometimes* fix it by simply twisting the ISO dial and the Aperture ring a few times to 'scratch off' the oxidised coating, but most times it's pretty well stuck on there and stops the pins contacting the dial surface properly.

*Remedy:*

Take off the ISO dial side of the top of the camera. Carefully get down to the contacts, then give them a rub with an eraser (yes, seriously), then finish the clean off with a cottonbud/q-tip dipped in rubbing/medicinal/isopropyl alcohol, or contact cleaner if you have any. Maybe give the little nibs of the ISO/Aperture contact pins a very quick dib as well with the cotton bud (*but don't force or bend the pins, literally just touch them with the cottonbud*). Then wait to dry, and reassemble again with care. DO NOT scratch the dial surface with anything harsher, as that will damage the dial and introduce new surfaces for oxidation and corrosion to occur. Moderate pressure with an eraser for tougher stains, [but even the cottonbud with alcohol/contact cleaner does the trick as you can see from the 'After' picture](https://preview.redd.it/before-and-after-xe-contact-oxidation-cleaning-v0-7r3a8qk8mqvd1.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=fdce370a4c9fd2f8ed0b0f2941ebc0169c97df89).

I've glossed over the disassembly as you can just follow this [very helpful video by Crescent Cameras](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8e5MFq9zSM) which covers the problem and how to fix it. You ONLY need to dissemble the Left side of the Top cover, nothing else. 

Personally, I would advise taking a picture of the parts at each step of unscrewing or removing something. Also, be careful of some of the parts concerning the ISO dial and underneath, they have very small spacing rings that can fall off and are very difficult to find if you drop them. The video mentions this as well, but getting to the dial itself requires unscrewing a small clasp for the wires on the right - take care with that one, and if you can leave the screw in the wire clasp, as you can just slide the contact dial back in afterwards and realign the pieces using the screw already in the clasp hole.

*Where:*

Initially, [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/9codjn/minolta_xe_lightmeter_repair/). [Crescent Cameras](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8e5MFq9zSM) also details this fix in it's entirety, and [I've posted about it once for myself](https://www.reddit.com/r/minolta/comments/1g7ce7l/before_and_after_xe_contact_oxidation_cleaning/)

#### Stiffening or Broken Power Switch

*What:*

After regular use, you notice your XE's Power Switch increasing requiring more force to turn On or Off. Maybe one day it just breaks, and is now loose on your camera and doesn't turn the camera On/Off.

*Why:*

The Power Switch is hardened plastic, but the switch actuates [this metal tab internally behind it](https://preview.redd.it/xe-1-power-switch-and-sheared-screw-repair-v0-oxshga1hbs3b1.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=f9ff8534ce0fd3a08d4a2f87e025ba0723fa4510). This can get stiff as grease dries, and repeated torque on the switch's plastic teeth eventually break the switch away from the tab. the camera itself is still functional, you just can't turn it On or Off.

*Remedy:*

The Quickfix is to just unscrew the Power Switch from the XE with some small needle-nose pliers (insert the prongs into the holes that keep it screwed on, and unscrew), then actuate the tab manually with some sort of implement. This is a quick jerryrig option and doesn't fix the underlying problem however.

To fix it longterm, you need to disassemble the Top cover of the XE, specifically the Prism Cover and the Right side. The Right side is problematic, as the adcance lever screwpiece is made of soft brass and can break off if you aren't careful, **especially** when tightening it back on after the fix. Follow [this video](https://youtu.be/69RYYe_VvoM) to remove the required top cover parts (but ignore the left side). Adjacent to the On/Off actuator is a small screw, [roughly behind the 'OFF' sign](https://preview.redd.it/xe-1-power-switch-and-sheared-screw-repair-v0-oxshga1hbs3b1.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=f9ff8534ce0fd3a08d4a2f87e025ba0723fa4510). Loosen that screw slightly, then check the force require to move the On/Off actuator. Once you're happy with it, you can test it with a fresh replacement from spare parts or a [3D Printed replacement](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/g8VYodLbwXm-minolta-xe-power-switch-lever). Then re-assemble the top cover parts, paying great attention and care to the Advance Lever screwpiece. It's advisable to screw it on with toothpicks or just by hand rather than with a tool as you can overtighten and break off the screw inside the Advance Lever Post (very very bad).

*Where:*

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/minolta/comments/1e9vxve/minolta_xe7_power_switch_stuck/), a [few times](https://www.reddit.com/r/minolta/comments/16zvi4r/onoff_switch_broken/). [I have performed the fix myself](https://www.reddit.com/r/minolta/comments/13z9kap/xe1_power_switch_and_sheared_screw_repair/), as well as the extra repair when I broke the Advance Lever Screwpiece. There's also other methods to fix the problem, like [drilling a metal pin into place of the teeth](https://www.reddit.com/r/minolta/comments/14cqhkk/fixed_my_xe7_onoff_switch/), or [melting one into place](https://i.imgur.com/quI3A8Z.jpeg).
