## Draft

I've got so far off the top of my head;
- SRT (Mirror baffle flap coming loose, battery substitutions (already done), aperture string coming off the roller)
- XK (mirror lock up 'issue')
- XE (Stiff switch/advance lever screw shearing during repairs, non responsive metering dial oxidation)
- XD (Mirror Dampener Sticky Piston Shutter Delay, Spool breaking, non responsive metering dial oxidation (less common))
- XG, X-:100: (Capacitor shenanigans, I already have an FAQ on the worst affected models and how to fix however)
- A-mounts (Not very much - sticky grip fixes/replacements, 7000 aperture magnet failure, a9 ti feature upgrade, a7 aperture gear replacements (already linked).
- CL (Meter arm breaking off)
- CLE (Spool breaking)
