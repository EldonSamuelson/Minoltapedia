# **Fairly Frequently Asked Questions**

This page holds a lot of FAQ's to answer some common questions about Minolta cameras. Please see the respective question for the original source(s) of the information.

### **Disclaimer** 

*Some of these FFAQ's deal with DIY repairs and modifications. **These can damage equipment permanently if you aren't careful**!*  

*Repair advice offered on the assumption that you already have some experience fixing cameras and are confident in your abilities to not cause further damage to your gear. As such, the authors of the links and the Minoltapedia are not responsible for any damages, injury, or expenses in repairs caused by following advice linked below unprepared.*

As a side note, I strongly recommend reading and taking the Learn Camera repairs' [Camera Repair Course](https://learncamerarepair.com/productlist.php?category=1) offered before attempting **any** repairs if you aren't familiar with fixed delicate complicated equipment.

### **What is the best Minolta SLR?**

So, you want a Minolta Manual Focus SLR - but the information out there is confusing, there's loads of different models, and you don't want to wade through hundreds of pages and video reviews? This decision chart might be for you!

Bear in mind that the chart is a simplification - it separates models and variants by sometimes only a single feature, but there might be more behind the camera. When you reach a final recommendation, it's a good idea to research the model to confirm it is the future Minolta SLR of your dreams. You can use [Minman's Archived SLR Comparison page](https://web.archive.org/web/20231001114811/http://subclub.org/minman/slrtable.php) to learn more about your speciifc model and variant.

If you are looking for a Minolta AutoFocus SLR's, I would recommend using [MHohner's A-Mount Film Table](https://www.mhohner.de/sony-minolta/bodies.php?#film)

### **Why are there so many SRT's?**

The US, Japanese, and 'Other' (UK/EU/ME) markets had different model names for the SRT models. This was to control export market prices. Back then it made sense, since a photographer would only have access to models sold within their market and know straight away which is what. Today with international shipping however, it makes identifying models very confusing. To make matters worse, Minolta developed the SRT throughout their production, often with minute changes and sometimes with no outward name changes at all. 

Starting simply with just series name differences, the names of these changed depending on which regional market it was sold in.

### **Why do some SRT Models have different features?**

So we have the general series names, but Minolta developed the SRT throughout their production. Some have Mirror Lock Up's, Hotshoes, Split Prism Viewfinders, or Film Tab Holders, and some don't have any of these features at all! Even the CLC metering system that the SRT is known for was removed in the very latest models. It's very complicated, often confusing, and can be a real nuisance when you are looking for the 'best' SRT for you when there's 2-5 different versions of the SRT Model.

There's an entire community devoted to surveying SRT variants and you can go down a very deep rabbit hole if you want. For simplicity this compiles the information from a few resources and splits them into 6 Stages:

[![](%%SRTStageChart%%)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CHTmWVhXRP0UX37gO_RXB6Do8norKR8x/view?usp=sharing)

*Click the Image above to see this in Google Drive, where you can click on the models and read directly about the model and the differences (from external sources, Rokkorfiles and Minman).*

These changes were a result of balancing features available on SRT's by adding new developments whilst removing obsolete ones. This coincided as other Minolta models were being phased out (SR-1/2/3) and being released, as they didn't want an SRT to compete with the later XK (1972), XE (1974/75), XK-Motor (1976), and the XG/XD (both 1977).

- *Stage 0*: The SRT 101 became Minolta's flagship camera to replace the SR-7. The SR's would be sold concurrently until 1971.
- *Stage 1*: While Minolta developed the Budget (100) and Premium (102) SRT's, they improved the shutterspeed dial and the take-up spools of the SRT 101.
- *Stage 2*: They later removed the Mirror-Lock-Up (MLU) from the SRT 101 as it seemed to be a feature only 'Pros' would use on the new SRT 102. 
- *Stage 3*: Only a year after the 102's release, Minolta removed it's MLU which left the XK as the only 'Pro' camera with that feature.
- *Stage 4*: The introduction of the new SRT 200 series, which saw shutterspeed and hotshoe upgrades as well a Film Tab Memo holder on the filmdoor. All previous SRT-1xx models were discontinued.

Stages 5, 6, and 7 came year-after-year for SRT 200's which were a mix of cost cutting and updates as the XG & XD series were released.

- *Stage 6*:  The first cost-cutting measure was introduced which changed the metal aperture ring to plastic, and the locking Depth of Field preview mechanism become a 'push and hold' version. 
- *Stage 7*: Viewfinder focus aids were changed from a horizontal prism to split-prism which made it easier to use. The SRT 202's never saw this upgrade or any future changes, as they were discontinued. There was no reason to upgrade 202's further and put them against the new XD models, and they couldn't cheapen the model further because the SRT 201 and 200 existed below it.
- *Stage 8*: Another cost cutting measure as by then the remaining SRT's were obsolete as the fully electronic cameras took over. They removed the 2nd metering cell in the camera, which made part of the 'CLC' system on all previous SRT's. This also meant CLC name wasn't on the prisms.

As the SRT's were discontinued in 1981, the electronic X-300 (Budget/Basic), X-500 (Standard/Enthusiast), and X-700 (Premium/Pro) series were ushered in.

### **What Batteries Can I Use For an SRT Meter?**

**Why Use Mercury in the First Place?**

When SRT cameras were released between 1966 and 1981, Mercury-Oxide batteries were already in popular use for mobile electronics because of their long shelf life, large energy capacity, and stable voltage output at 1.35 Volts. The Mercury acted as a stabiliser for the chemical reaction, so they held their charge for a very long time, and didn't explode or leak (*very often*). 

Mercury is a toxic substance however - when the batteries are dumped, the Mercury leaks out of landfills and into drinking water. Workers would get sick making the batteries, and treatments are costly. By the mid-90's, most Western countries had restricted their manufacture and banned their commercial import or use. 

What replaced Mercury-Oxide was mostly Alkaline (A, AG, L, LR), Zinc-Air (ZA), or Silver-Oxide (SO, SG, SR) button cells. While they worked well in the more modern XE, XD, and X-hundred series, the different 1.5 Voltage and varying drain on these new batteries meant they couldn't work with the old SRT's system. The SRT meters didn't regulate Voltage, so they would under and over expose depending whether the battery was old or new.

Since the 2000's as the remaining Mercury batteries died out, methods for working alternatives have sprung up. There are literally hundreds and thousands of webpages, articles, and forum posts giving advice, from Sunny 16 to battery substitution, soldering a voltage regulator in, or modifying the meter. So, here's a summary of the common and uncommon methods I've found with links to all of them.

**So What Alternative Should I Use?**

The table is ordered by how easy it is to complete the option - the first you could do with the camera in your hands right now. Each have their pros and cons, and the last one **is illegal** in most countries, but you can weigh the options and decide which one suits your needs (except the last one - that is objectively a bad option). *Some links allow for each option's purchase, but I am not affiliated with or recommending any of them by having them on the table.*

If you want to read more about each option or get into the discharge curves and details of the Mercury Battery Problem, you can read resources by [Bruce Varner](https://www.brucevarner.com/PX625Replacement.html), [Dick Sullivan](http://www.rokkorfiles.com/mercury.htm), ['Frugal' Mike](http://www.willegal.net/photo/srt/srt-mercury.htm), [KniPPsen](https://knippsen.blogspot.com/2016/02/px625-und-alternativen.html), [Mel](https://high5cameras.com/all-articles/spares-and-upgrades/whose-got-the-power-a-guide-to-classic-camera-batteries/), and [PhotoEthnography](http://www.photoethnography.com/ClassicCameras/batteries.html). [F. de Gruijter (PDF)](http://rick_oleson.tripod.com/batt_adapt_us.pdf) is probably the most detailed and authoritative on the issue, and the technical differences between battery types.

### **Will My Minolta Have a Capacitor Problem?**

It depends! 

- **SR & SRT** models are mechanically operated, meaning they don't need capacitors in the first place to power anything.
- **XK's, XE's, and XD's** don't get capacitor issues. *The cameras can still fail and stop working*, of course, but capacitors are not expected to be the cause of failure in those models, as they had more reliable Tantalum capacitors that look like a bulbous blue berry. 
- **XG's** were more likely to have Tantalum capacitors, but it's not guaranteed. You can identify Tantalum caps by their blue bulbous look. The ones to be concerned about are the Aluminium capacitors, that are a cylindrical black or dark blue. [Here's a comparison](https://i.imgur.com/K8yWc1x.png).

Solid Tantalum Electrolytic Capacitors (STEC's) are more reliable and longer lasting, but more expensive to produce. Aluminium Liquid Electrolytic Capacitors (ALEC's) are far cheaper, but less reliable. In the 80's, Tantalum prices went up, so STEC's got replaced with ALEC's. This happens to coincide with releases of Minolta cameras at the time, and as remaining STEC stock ran out, the ALEC's became standard.

The models to be aware of for capacitor problems are;

- ***Some* later model XG's** - It's more likely that the XG models with the [new Minolta logo](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/camerapedia/images/8/82/MinoltaXG1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110202213840) *are more likely* to have Aluminium capacitors, but it is not a guaranteed method of testing. You will only be certain by taking off the base plate of the camera, or if the camera is exhibiting classic signs of capacitoritis. 
     - Older XG Minoltas with the [lower-case logo](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiDCKFN2fdFJ8AES8TtRHstrQHD4Wc_NsBDQw6hL-8kqVmka8ucDTasGzYdJJEoELXbKEvepHImoo4ieHzhBOjFqgfPG84wBoKWcma-DlmNs9YDZ5KMQn1suT2pI55as6WgqN5ybrPkfqtO/s1600/P1029730.jpg) are less likely to encounter issues, but also don't have the same circuitry. If you experience capacitoritis problems, the capacitor is [located similar to the X-700's](https://www.678vintagecameras.ca/uploads/6/6/3/7/66371031/img-20190205-102214_1_orig.jpg). 
  
- ***Most* X-300/370's** - They were the budget alternative to the X-700, so they weren't expected to be used for long (40 years). Also by the time they released in 1984, by then Minolta had used most of their remaining Tantalum capacitors. Again though, only checking underneath the baseplate will confirm this.
  
- ***Most* X-700's** In the first few runs of the camera, The X-700 was given the expensive more reliable STEC/Tantalum capacitors because it was the 'Pro' camera which was expected to be reliable. That means *very early* X-700's below serial no. 20xxxxxx got reliable capacitors and don't have issues. However, X-700's were made until the 1990's, so all later serial numbers got the less reliable ALEC's. To make it worse, X-700's have *x2* capacitors that can fail, and [in difficult places to reach](https://i.imgur.com/jLbdaZx.png) for DIY repairs.

These are not set-in-stone truths, however. As time goes on, people get their cameras repaired. You might find any of these cameras with a freshly replaced capacitor from today. These are still ALEC capacitors, but with far better reliability than ones built 50 years ago.

**Should I Replace My Capacitors Anyway?**

  *You should only replace the capacitor if the symptoms of a dying/dead capacitor are apparent!!!*

- The meter lights up on half-press or touch of the shutter button
- ...but on full press of the shutter button the LED meter turns off and the shutter does not release (when the camera wind lever has been advanced/wound on and prepared to shoot). The meter does not turn on when you attempt to press the button again.
- *Sometimes* in addition, the LED meter will only flash the overexposure '🔺' arrow before dying, or the meter will run through all the shutterspeed LED's in sequence until the '🔺' arrow, regardless of lighting in the scene.
- On turning the camera off and on again, the same symptoms repeat.

In those cases, refer to the repair articles by [678vintagecameras](https://www.678vintagecameras.ca/blog/what-was-up-with-minolta-and-capacitors) (all affected models), [EverythingVintage](https://everythingvintage.uk/vintage-camera/minolta-xg-m-capacitor-replacement/) & [Andreas Thaler](https://www.photrio.com/forum/threads/minolta-xg-m-replacing-the-electrolytic-capacitors.203831/) (XG-M's), [High5Cameras](https://high5cameras.com/all-articles/repair/minolta-x-700-capacitor-replacement/) (X-700), and [Paul Beesley](https://www.paulbeesley.com/posts/minolta-x500x700-capacitor-repair) (X-500/300) for repairs if you are confident. If you aren't, you can also get them repaired professionally in most vintage camera repair shops.

## Lens FFAQ's
***

### **What Do Letters On MC Rokkor Lenses Mean?**

As you might have already seen on your lenses, [some Minolta lenses](http://minolta.eazypix.de/lenses/index.html) have 2-letter suffixes after 'Rokkor'. If you're very fortunate, you might even have an earlier Auto-Rokkor or an original SR lens with two letters like '*PF*'.

- It's not always unique. 50mm, 53mm, 55mm, 58mm, 85mm, 100mm, and 135mm lenses can all be an 'MC Rokkor-*PF*'.
- It's not a grading system. The 16mm f/2,8 'MC Fish-Eye Rokkor-*OK*' is better than ok, it's really good.
- It can't be a manufacturing location. The 21mm 'MC W.Rokkor-*NL*' lenses were made in Japan, not the Netherlands.

Jokes aside, it's about the Elements and Groupings of the glass inside the lens. The first letter is tied to how many *Groups* of Elements there are, following the mathematical designation:

The P in '*PF*' means 5 Groups.

| 1st Grouping Letter  | T   | Q    | P    | H   | S    | O   | N   |
|:----------------:|:---:|:----:|:----:|:---:|:----:|:---:|:---:|
| Math Designation* | *Tri* | *Quad* | *Pent* | *Hex* | *Sept* | *Oct* | *Non* |
| \# of Groups      | 3   | 4    | 5    | 6   | 7    | 8   | 9   |


\* *If this doesn't make sense, think of polygons. Pentagon, Hexagon, Septagon, etc.*

Then the second letter covers the amount of *Elements* in the lens and is simply tied to the letters' position in the Alphabet:

The F in '*PF*' means 6 Elements

| 2nd Element Letter | C | D | E | F | G | H | I |  J |  K |  L |
|:--------------:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|  \# of Elements | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 |

So if P means *Penta* groups and the F means 6 Elements, the Lens has 6 Element in 5 Groups!

**Between Two Similar Lenses, Can This Infer Quality?**

Sort of. 

Earlier original SR lenses like the 35mm W.Rokkor QE f/4 (*5 Elements in 4 Groups*) were slower compared to the later 35mm MC W.Rokkor HH f/1.8 (*8 Elements in 7 Groups*). You also see this with the MC-Rokkor PG lenses with 1 extra Element being ~1/3 of a stop faster than their PF counterparts, but then the focus is harder to make at that extra stop gained because it gives a narrower Depth of Field. 

For later MD lenses this information isn't helpful, as no MD Lens has this naming feature. You'd have to look up that information online, but then you'd find many MD Lenses have *less* Elements and Groups than their earlier MC counterparts, but are faster or considered generally better. This is because of their more advanced glass coatings which came later with the MD lenses.

If you want to read more about it, you can check out Minolta Lens Designations by [Dennis Lohmann](http://minolta.eazypix.de/lenses/index.html#clas) or by [Henrik Robeck](http://minolta.rokkor.de/lensdesignations.htm). You can also read more generally into Minolta Lenses by [Rokkorfiles](http://www.rokkorfiles.com/Lens%20History.html) and [Minman](https://web.archive.org/web/20211021170337/http://www.subclub.org/minman/slrlens.htm) which refer to the Lens Designations and their eventual removal when MC III (aka 'Rokkor-X') and MD lenses started production.

### **Why Does My Lens Not Fit On My Minolta?**

There is a very common mistake that any lens that says 'MC' on it is for Minolta mount cameras. Unfortunately this isn't true and can lead to compatibility problems. Here's how to make sure a lens is definitely for Minolta Manual Focus! (AKA SR mount);
#### MC Lens Identification
- 'MC' is often confused as Minolta meant it to mean 'Meter Coupling', but 3rd party brands used it to mean 'Multi-Coated'.
- If it just says ['MC' on the front ring](https://allphotolenses.com/public/files/img/348f90a614fca58ec351417edfe6df79.jpg) like this, that is not a reliable way to tell the mount of the lens. This is an M42 lens, not for SR.
- To reiterate, Minolta MC doesn't mean '[Multi-Coated](https://allphotolenses.com/public/files/img/93932177ffa230b1af7be64aaa531d1c.jpg). This is also a non-compatible lens.
- If it says [MC-Rokkor](https://allphotolenses.com/public/files/img/6fbfa2bd7b52ba1705e68c15cf32a6cc.jpg), [MC-Rokkor-X](https://lens-db.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/20110625-008-XL.jpg), or [MC Rokkor-*XY*](https://phillipreeve.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Minolta_MC_50mmf1p4-1.jpg) alongside the Minolta name, it is compatible.
#### MD Lens Identification
- Minolta was the only one to make MD lenses, so it will say [MD-Rokkor](http://allphotolenses.com/public/files/img/b0bba957fc9ed5c2cba6978ecc16a433.jpg), [MD Rokkor-X](https://radojuva.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/minolta-md-rokkor-x-50mm-1-7-1.jpg), or just [MD](https://images.sellbrite.com/production/58025/305/7e35295f-87cc-5748-a40e-3fa8884c4ef5.jpg) on the front ring, alongside the Minolta name.
- It means 'Meter Diaphragm', for Program and Shutter Priority modes of later Minolta cameras.
#### Rear Lens Identification
- Minolta SR (MC/MD) mount changed a couple of times during development, but it has always looked relatively the same. It always has had [a 3-pronged bayonet](https://japb.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/SR1.jpg), with the aperture linkage (2) opposite the bayonet with the nick in it (1). 
- Later [MC-Rokkor and MD lenses](https://japb.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MD1.jpg) got the aperture meter coupling tab (4) and minimum diaphragm tab (5), respectively
#### Alternate Identification Methods (for 3rd Party Minolta Mount Lenses)
- Other methods work better with 3rd Party lenses, as they won't carry the 'Minolta MC-Rokkor', Rokkor', or 'Minolta MD' name on the front ring.
- Most 3rd parties are kind enough to state it directly on the back, such as '[M/MD](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/images/images2500x2500/Tamron_C52300_Adaptall_Mount_for_Minolta_53481.jpg)' on the lens mount or [on the barrel](https://allphotolenses.com/public/files/img/417c5e02c710fae9f9dad3f731487f17.jpg). It may also come across as '[for MINOLTA MD](https://theclassiccamera.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tuesday-9.jpg)' or just '[Minolta](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/XtMAAOSwOCFke9eM/s-l1600.jpg)'.
- Older 3rd parties may refer to the [original SR](https://s.ecrater.com/stores/74726/4daa3eab93da0_74726b.jpg) but are less common.
- There may be a combination of all these. For example, 'SR/MC for MINOLTA' or 'SR/MD' or 'M/SR'
#### Older Minolta Lens Identification
This is mostly for posterity, as these older SR lenses are so old that they aren't likely to be seen very often or confused with anything else.
- [Auto Rokkor (SR-AR)](http://minolta.rokkor.de/lens/normals/552ar132front.jpg) lenses lack the MD and MC tabs, and the aperture linkage is very long. The very old ones have the linkage connected to a ring that rotates along outside, instead of the tiny linkage you see on later Minolta lenses. They almost always say 'Auto Rokkor' and no one made any 3rd party copies, so they aren't easy to confuse.
- [Original SR](https://allphotolenses.com/public/files/img/a47ec1a0810970ecdeef2bd27d2a09fe.JPG) were the very first Minolta SR mount lenses, and lack even the aperture linkage. They always say 'Rokkor-*XY*'. There were very few 3rd party manufacturers making Minolta lenses this early, and you'll likely never see one to get confused about them in the first place.

### **Are There Radioactive Minolta Lenses?**

From Geiger counter testing by members of the Minolta Collectors' Group on Facebook, there are known to be only 4 radioactive lenses made by Minolta.

These 4 are radioactive because their glass elements contained Thorium or Lanthanum, periodic Elements that have a high [refractive index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_index). Thorium/Lanthanum glass reduced Chromatic Aberrations, by stopping light splitting and dispersing as it passes through the glass (think *Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd*). As a side effect, it made the lenses mildly radioactive since the glass could be made of up the 30% of radioactive Elements. Based on these lens surveys however, they are only *very mildly* radioactive. We'll get to that later.


All of this data in these tables was by researched members of the [Minolta Collector's Group on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/minoltacollectors/permalink/5314503005255341/), and the original post by Maury J. goes more into detail on the general methodology for measuring radioactivity.

| Lens Name | Affected [Lens Type](http://minolta.eazypix.de/lenses/index.html#clas) | Radioactive/Surveyed, % | Average Radioactivity (μSieverts/hour)[*] | Location of Radioactivity | Highest *known* Radioactive Lens Serial # |Source(s)|

\[\*] *The average is calculated for only the radioactive lenses.*

\[\*\*] *The average is calculated for only 4/6 radioactive lenses that had available measurements taken.*


**Is the 85mm f/1.7 Lens Radioactive too?**

There were rumours that a fifth lens (an MC Rokkor 85mm f/1.7) might be radioactive, however there's no proof that Minolta made a radioactive 85mm lens. [The original claim](https://web.archive.org/web/20120414014001/http://www.dg77.net/photo/x500/mc85.htm) cited an MC-I version of the 85mm lens used radioactive components, but there isn't an [85mm MC-I model in existence](http://minolta.eazypix.de/lenses/index.html#:~:text=1970-,mc%20ii,-647).

Unfortunately the myth of a radioactive 85mm lens persisted and spread, including being reproduced on the Rokkorfiles website. It has since been [debunked](https://www.facebook.com/groups/minoltacollectors/posts/5575023332536639/?comment_id=5593917983980507&reply_comment_id=5594008610638111) and even by the author of Rokkorfiles himself. Unfortunately the Rokkorfiles creator does not maintain the website any more and cannot correct the mistake, so this table aims to keep setting the record straight;

| Lens Name | [Lens Type](http://minolta.eazypix.de/lenses/index.html#clas) | Radioactive/Surveyed, % | Average Radioactivity (μSieverts/hour) | Location of Radioactivity | Earliest Surveyed Serial # |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:| 
|MC Rokkor-PF (85mm f/1.7)| *MC-I ?*|[0/20](https://i.imgur.com/ZwpPzK7.jpeg)*| 0 | N/A | SN [2501007](https://i.imgur.com/ZwpPzK7.jpeg), 7th 85mm lens made |

\* *20 MC-II models were surveyed, including an extremely early production serial number of the lens, yet none were found to be radioactive.*

 **What about \[*Insert any other Minolta Lens*]**?

Is it on the list? Then probably not.

Radioactive lenses were only used by Minolta in an early and short period of time (60's - early 70's) before lens designs and manufacturing got better. They were also more expensive to produce, so across all lens manufacturers they were mostly restricted to Prime lens ranges used by professionals (24-35mm, 85-100mm, fast lenses <f/2.8). That means a common MD 50mm f/2 lens made in the late 1980's is almost certainly not going to radioactive. 

*However...*

We only know table of radioactive lenses above because they were tested by the community. If you test *any* Minolta lens with a Geiger counter or other radioactive measuring device and it picks up something, we'd love to see the results so serial numbers or even a new lens model can be included in the radioactive table! All credit will be attributed to whoever finds one.

***

#### **Are Radioactive Lenses Dangerous?**

So, some Minolta lenses are radioactive. But are they dangerous? Not at all. These are measured with the detector right up to the glass, whereas the strength of radioactivity decreases rapidly with distance from the source. At 1 metre or 3 feet away from the back of the lens pointed at you, there is no detectable radioactivity. If you put the lens cap on or mounted it on a camera, the radioactivity distance would be reduced to just that space inside.

 For a [comparison of Radioactivity](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Radiation_Dose_Chart_by_Xkcd.png), an average daily Background Radiation dose is between 2-10 μSv, a Dental X-Ray is 5 μSv, a Chest X-Ray is 20 μSv. A yearly dose that is clearly linked to increased cancer risk is 100 *m*Sv. Let's do some math;

 100 mSv / 6 μSv per hour = 16,666 Hours, or 694 Days. Even if you strapped the rear element of the most radioactive MC Rokkor-PG 58mm lens to your body for an entire year, you couldn't increase your risk of cancer. You are safe.

### **Can I adapt other lens mounts to Minolta SR/MC/MD?**

Officially, Minolta provided support for only 3 lens mounts, with a simple letter-based adapter system;

- **['P' Adaptor](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/ivpziv/finally_scored_an_original_m42_to_minolta_md/)** - For **P**entax (or **P**raktica) M42 screwmount. This was a simple adaptor that only allowed for stop-down metering. The lens would be pre-set at the aperture when the meter was taken and the shutter released. Whilst it was designed for Pentax' M42 lenses in mind, it's compatible with the universal M42 screwmount found on lenses found in the former Soviet Union (Praktica, Carl Zeiss, Zenit, Contax), Japan (Mamiya, Yashica, Tamron, Tokina, Soligor, Fuji), and now China with some TTartisan lenses being released in M42.
- **['E' Adaptor](https://randomphoto.blogspot.com/2007/06/minakta-or-exolta.html)** - For **E**xakta bayonet mount. Similar to the P-Adapter, the lenses could only be used with the aperture pre-set, for stop-down metering only. This adaptor was intended for lenses commonly found in East Germany (Carl Zeiss Jena, Pentacon, Meyer) as well as some early Japanese manufacturers' lenses (i.e. Topcon, Nikon).
- **['L' Adaptor](http://forum.mflenses.com/minolta-adaptersoriginal-p-and-l-adapters-t36916.html)** - This was for **L**eica's Thread Mount (LTM), otherwise known as M39 screwmount. This was [specifically designed or use with a bellows for Macro photography and copying](https://minoltaflashback.com/bellows.html#:~:text=USING%20THE%20MINOLTA%20ADPATER%20%E2%80%9CL%E2%80%9D%20ON%20A%20BELLOWS). As such, stop down metering was required, and even focus was controlled via the bellows instead of focusing the lens. You would attach the bellows to the camera through the regular Minolta SR-mount, then attach the L-Adaptor to the bellows. Whilst LTM lenses could theoretically fit onto this adaptor, it was only designed for bellows-work, so most non-macro lenses (i.e. LTM rangefinder lenses) would not be in focus.
  
Today you can find cheap adaptors for various mounts from 3rd Party Vendors for adaptation. Many use glass corrective elements to adapt the lens to Minolta SR, and don't produce good images as a result. It's best to stick native SR-mount lenses, or adapted M42/Exacta lenses using the P/E adaptor.

*There is no way to retroactively adapt modern DSLR or Mirrorless lenses to Minolta SR in any way.*

***

### **Can I adapt Minolta Manual Focus (SR/MC/MD) lenses to Autofocus Minolta AF and Sony A-Mount Cameras?**

There are LA-EA Adaptors for A-mount to E-mount, and adaptors for Minolta SR/MC/MD to Sony E-Mount, but Minolta SR/MC/MD to A-Mount adaptors are very uncommon. When the Minolta Autofocus A-mount came in 1985, the older Manual Focus Minolta mount were quietly dropped from support, and new lenses stopped being made entirely by the mid 1990's. Konica Minolta and Sony didn't even bother making an SR to A-mount adaptor by their period of ownership. 

For a brief time however, Minolta did make official 'M/A Converters', an ['M/A-S' for lenses <300mm](https://www.mhohner.de/sony-minolta/onelens/ma_s), and an ['M/A-L' for 300mm and above](https://www.mhohner.de/sony-minolta/onelens/ma_l). They adapt Minolta SR lenses to A-mount, but also act as x2 teleconverters (i.e. An MD 50mm f/1.7 becomes functionally a 100mm f/3.5 when adapted). They require stop down metering of the aperture to function on an A-mount camera. They are 'dumb' adaptors, lacking any electrical contacts to communicate EXIF-metadata with the camera. This requires changing a setting on your Minolta/Konica-Minolta A-mount camera to allow shutter release without a lens mounted as the adaptor is not detected. There is a section for this in the [Minoltapedia Guides](https://www.reddit.com/r/MinoltaGang/about/wiki/index/minoltopedia/ffaq/#wiki_can_i_adapt_minolta_.28sr.2Fmc.2Fmd.29_lenses_to_minolta_and_sony_a-mount.3F). You can learn more about their general performance [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20220530072414/https://www.clubsnap.com/threads/minolta-2x-m-a-converter-s-another-bridge-to-use-old-minolta-manual-lenses-on-alphas.1058857/). These are the best available as they were the only official adaptors. They're harder to find nowadays, but are occasionally on Ebay. Just search '[Minolta M/A Converter](https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2380057.m570.l1313&_nkw=Minolta+M%2FA+converter&_sacat=0)' and you will eventually find a few.

There were also 3rd party ones offered by Sigma in the 1980's, and some unbranded ones by another company. There's not as much information on these, but you can read more about what adapter/converters were available on [Dyxum](https://www.dyxum.com/lenses/teleconverters.asp#:%7E:text=manual%20focus%20lens%20section:~:text=Manual%20Focus%20Lens%20Section) (*Ctrl-F, 'Manual Focus Lens Section'*). There are also modern adaptors by [Fotodiox](https://www.amazon.de/Fotodiox-Adapter-Minolta-Mount-Cameras/dp/B0048A8CDU) that teleconvert by x1.4 (i.e. 50mm becomes ~70mm), but these are of lower quality as they add a cheap glass element to adapt them.

The alternative and better recommended option for manual focus lenses on an autofocus or digital camera is to have a Mirrorless camera with an adaptor. They don't use corrective glass or teleconvert the focal length, however they have their own cost vs quality considerations. You can read more about these from [Phillip Reeve's Blog](https://phillipreeve.net/blog/guide-adapters-minolta-mc-md-lenses/).

### **Minolta 'F.W. Rokkor' Lenses, what are they?**

Not much is known about them, but they are [suspected to be old copy-projection lenses for 70's Minolta office photocopiers]((https://forum.opticallimits.com/showthread.php?tid=5259)). 

If you are in the market for large format lens adaptation, I would not advise using these as they were built for extremely short focus distances.

### **Minolta lenses with 'x33/x42' and gearteeth on the side. What are they?**

I.E. [They look like this](https://preview.redd.it/xt7jo8enjwzc1.jpeg?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=702dd201b5396c049f14298f9622b9e73f810959)

Those are from a Microfilm/Microfiche Reader-Printer. You can [remove the Prism](https://forum.mflenses.com/quite-an-unusual-minolta-lens-t78657.html#1506657) and with some careful adaptation can be used a highly magnifying Macro lens. You can also just [use them with the original equipment they were designed for](https://www.microfilmworld.com/pre-ownedminoltarp600zmicrofichereaderprinter.aspx), if MicroFiche Readers are your thing.

### **What's the deal with 'Minolta Digital' and MND cameras?**

In short, there was a dubious Trademark dispute involving US Patent Law in the mid-2010's, and Minolta (Konica Minolta) lost. The Trademark of 'Minolta' was then passed to a US-registered licensing company called JMM Lee, and they proceeded to sell their license to EliteBrands, who manufacture crappy cameras under a '[Zombie Trademark](https://attorneyatlawmagazine.com/zombie-trademark)'. You can find unbranded copies of their 'MND' and 'MNZ' cameras on AliExpress at a fraction of their costs advertised on US shopping channels or Amazon.

If they are considered 'Minolta', then I have an Minolta-brand  bridge to sell you. **Don't buy them**, at best they have no relation to old Minolta, and at worst are the modern-era equivalent of a '[scamera](https://mikeeckman.com/2019/04/canon-dl-9000-the-scamera/)'.

If you are interested in the Trademark Patent dispute, you can [read a Draft/Review article](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OeuuAl6OBq0QvwslPRhQUADA3xqt1U-p/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=102438540267148654789&rtpof=true&sd=true) written up to cover this FAQ that kind of ballooned into it's own thing. (I would appreciate any critique and comments on the draft before I finally 'publish' it somewhere!)
